# Boots üêµ

BOOTS (Beautiful Object-Oriented Training System) is a intro module to object-oriented programming for use in voice applications. All content is completely free to use as you wish - clone, remix, share - though credit is appreciated üçª.

Boots is developed in three versions: Java, Python, and Javascript. For beginning to novice programmers, Python is recommended. However, if you have previous experience in Java, this works as well.

The Javascript module is only recommended to advanced programmers willing to pull their hair out (though, I think it's the most fun).

## Objective

The primary goal is to build a simple voice assistant that can answer questions or perform tasks. The secondary goal is to understand exactly *why* object-oriented programming is useful, and how it has real-life applications.

## End Result

By the end of this module, you will have your own fully functioning voice assistant that can outperform anything else in the market, because *you* built it for exactly *your needs*.

I have used all methods developed in this module to build my very own voice assistant, Ultron. Today, Ultron controls all the lights in my house, he logs all my workouts and weights, and even he runs tests on my code in real-time!

## Jump In

Okay, enough preface. Open the directory of your langauge of choice and let's get to building.
